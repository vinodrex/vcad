# Azure API Management Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure API Management. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections. For categories with line ranges (e.g., `L35-L120`), use `read_file` with the specified lines. For categories with file links (e.g., `[security.md](security.md)`), use `read_file` on the linked reference file

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content:
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill`. Returns Markdown.
- **Fallback**: Use `fetch_webpage` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill&accept=text/markdown`. Returns Markdown.

| Security | L100-L141 | Securing APIs and APIM: authN/Z (Entra ID, B2C, OAuth2, JWT, mTLS, basic), managed identities/RBAC, secure portals/self-hosted gateways, security policies, and DDoS/Defender protections. |
| Configuration | L142-L236 | Configuring Azure API Management services, gateways, networks, caching, monitoring, and detailed policy behaviors (rate limits, CORS, headers, LLM/GraphQL, backends, domains, and developer portal). |
| Integrations & Coding Patterns | L237-L268 | Patterns and samples for integrating API Management with external services (LLMs, Event Hubs, Service Bus, Graph, GitHub, Dapr), importing APIs (OpenAPI, SAP, web apps), and using policies/callouts. |
