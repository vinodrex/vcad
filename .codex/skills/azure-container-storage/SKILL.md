description: Expert knowledge for Azure Container Storage development including troubleshooting, decision making, limits & quotas, security, and configuration. Use when configuring CMK-encrypted Elastic SAN volumes, ACS pools, LRS/ZRS redundancy, volume resize, or v1 installs, and other Azure Container Storage related development tasks. Not for Azure Blob Storage (use azure-blob-storage), Azure Files (use azure-files), Azure Elastic SAN (use azure-elastic-san), Azure NetApp Files (use azure-netapp-files).
compatibility: Requires network access. Uses mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch or fetch_webpage to retrieve documentation.

# Azure Container Storage Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Container Storage. Covers troubleshooting, decision making, limits & quotas, security, and configuration. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections. For categories with line ranges (e.g., `L35-L120`), use `read_file` with the specified lines. For categories with file links (e.g., `[security.md](security.md)`), use `read_file` on the linked reference file

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content:
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill`. Returns Markdown.
- **Fallback**: Use `fetch_webpage` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill&accept=text/markdown`. Returns Markdown.
