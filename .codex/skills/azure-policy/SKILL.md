description: Expert knowledge for Azure Policy development including troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. Use when authoring Machine Configuration packages, deploying via ARM/Bicep/Terraform, mapping CIS/NIST baselines, migrating from DSC, or querying compliance with Resource Graph, and other Azure Policy related development tasks. Not for Azure Blueprints (use azure-blueprints), Azure Role-based access control (use azure-rbac), Azure Resource Manager (use azure-resource-manager), Azure Security (use azure-security).
compatibility: Requires network access. Uses mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch or fetch_webpage to retrieve documentation.

# Azure Policy Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Policy. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections. For categories with line ranges (e.g., `L35-L120`), use `read_file` with the specified lines. For categories with file links (e.g., `[security.md](security.md)`), use `read_file` on the linked reference file

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content:
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill`. Returns Markdown.
- **Fallback**: Use `fetch_webpage` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill&accept=text/markdown`. Returns Markdown.
